### Greetings, loved ones.

Some code forked from Leon Noel that I was tasked with fixing.  It was a '21 Savage' fan site with a user login and a message board; CRUD stuff.  I added 'thumbs down' functionality to the code as well as a trash can to delete messages.  Nothing to spectacular.  It works, yay.
